    <h1>The Great Pyramid – the way it was built</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Building the Great Pyramid, the last surviving “7 wonders of the world”, was arguably the greatest project undertaken by man.</li>
      <li>The 5000 year mystery can be explained in 5 minutes and is remarkably simple, though not obvious.</li>
      <li>No human would have started such an undertaking without confidence of success. That confidence was a machine mentioned by the historian Herodotus. We now have a working scale model of such a machine.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As today, Egypt was hot. Hard work out in the open would have been exhausting and the idea that stone blocks were dragged up slopes to build the pyramid is just not acceptable...</p>

    <p><strong>The numbers are staggering…</strong> The great pyramid is built of some 2.3 million blocks each weighing typically 2½ tons...</p>

    <p>Wheels would not be invented for another few hundred years. Log rollers and / or hardwood sliders may have been used...</p>

    <p>So what did they have? Stone, water, desert/sand, timber, peace, manpower and unusual local geography...</p>

    <p>Using only materials and knowledge available to the ancient Egyptians we have built a model “machine”...</p>

    <h2>The Concepts</h2>
    <p>A boat floats and goes up and down with the water level...</p>
    <p>Imagine a lock near the pyramid, supplied by the Nile in full flood...</p>
    <p>Let us say the boat in the nearly empty lock with its deck at ground level...</p>
    <p>I built a 100:1 scale model to show how it can be done.</p>

    <p>The model works. It uses a boat a similar size to that discovered in the boat pit...</p>
    <p>It has become clear the blocks must remain on a pallet or sled all the time they are in transit...</p>

    <p><strong>The Figures:</strong></p>
    <p>The great pyramid is built mostly of 2–3 ton cubes of limestone with 0.9m sides...</p>

    <h2>Pyramid First or Machine First</h2>
    <p>In building the model it became clear that any ‘machine’ with more than a few shelves/tables high resembles a modern lift shaft...</p>

    <p>This suggests there must be one, or more likely several, shafts running vertically through the pyramid...</p>

    <h2>The Capstone</h2>
    <p>The missing cap stone. Constructing the top layers would require stacking extra blocks...</p>

    <p>The model provides an understanding as to why the pyramids are only found on the West bank of the Nile...</p>

    <h2>Other Aspects</h2>
    <p>The Nile is the most obvious water source but the very large Lake Qarun overflows down waddis towards Giza...</p>

    <p>A key motivation for the pyramids might well have been the unused manpower available during the annual flooding season...</p>

    <h2>Herodotus</h2>
    <p>The renowned historian wrote his history of Egypt some 300–500 years after the temples were built...</p>
