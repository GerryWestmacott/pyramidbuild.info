    <h1>A Summary of the Pyramid Building Machine</h1>
    <h2>The Great Pyramid – The Way It Was Built</h2>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Building the Great Pyramid, the last surviving “7 wonders of the world”, was arguably the greatest project undertaken by man.</li>
      <li>The 5000-year mystery can be explained in 5 minutes and is remarkably simple, though not obvious.</li>
      <li>No human would have started such an undertaking without confidence of success. That confidence was a machine mentioned by the historian Herodotus. We now have a working scale model of such a machine.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Estimates have suggested that 100,000 men would be required to build the pyramid, but recent research shows local facilities could support about 20,000 people. Most were part-time farmers working during the Nile's annual inundation.</p>

    <p>The Great Pyramid is built of some 2.3 million blocks each weighing about 2½ tons, with a total weight of approximately 6½ million tons. It stands 145 meters (480 feet) tall. Wheels had not been invented yet; likely, log rollers or hardwood sliders were used. The Egyptians had stone, water, desert/sand, timber, peace, manpower, and favorable geography.</p>

    <p>A model “machine” made from stone and wood shows the Great Pyramid could have been built in 10–20 years by 10,000–20,000 workers.</p>

    <h3>The Concept</h3>
    <p>A boat floats and rises with the water level, like a boat in a canal lock. A large boat can support enormous weights (equal to the water displaced). The 46-meter-long boat found in the Giza boat pit could carry 200–400 tons.</p>

    <p>Imagine a lock near the pyramid, supplied by the Nile during flood and drained into the desert. By operating lock gates, a boat could cyclically rise and fall, transporting heavy stone blocks upwards in stages with docks/platforms at various heights.</p>

    <p>With multiple "tables" and "shelves" spaced vertically, stones could be progressively lifted higher using only water power and simple sliding mechanisms.</p>

    <h3>The 100:1 Scale Working Model</h3>
    <p>A model using a boat scaled to 46cm by 7cm demonstrates the process. Stone blocks and tree trunks create 10 levels, each 5cm apart, moving 8 blocks at a time to a height of 5 meters. With a six-minute cycle, the model could move 80 blocks per hour.</p>

    <p>Blocks are moved on sleds sliding on timber runners. Runners are balanced to create a slight downhill slope, allowing 2–3 men to move 5-ton loads with levers in minutes.</p>

    <h3>The Figures</h3>
    <p>The Great Pyramid uses 2–3 ton limestone blocks with 0.9-meter sides. An up-down cycle time of six minutes could theoretically move 3000 tons per day.</p>

    <p>Each shelf/table would need about 6 men. Using smaller loads with multiple machines could improve practicality and reduce congestion.</p>

    <h3>Pyramid First or Machine First?</h3>
    <p>The lift shaft requires support from the surrounding pyramid structure. Thus, pyramid construction and shaft construction were mutually dependent, suggesting vertical shafts and canals under the pyramid — possibly detectable today.</p>

    <h3>The Capstone</h3>
    <p>The missing capstone: Constructing the top layers would be challenging. It is possible the capstone slipped and could not be repositioned, explaining its absence.</p>

    <h3>Why the West Bank of the Nile?</h3>
    <p>Pyramids were built on the West Bank because the underground terrain allowed drainage of the lock system into the desert, unlike the East Bank.</p>

    <h3>Herodotus</h3>
    <p>The historian Herodotus wrote more than a thousand years later that the pyramids were built with a wooden machine and "built from the top down."</p>
