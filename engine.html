    <h1>The Great Pyramid – the way it was built</h1>
    <h2>The 500 Horsepower Engine</h2>
    <p><em>Perhaps the World’s first real engine</em></p>

    <h2>What do we mean by “engine”?</h2>
    <p>
      We mean some device that provides <strong>useable POWER</strong>. Prior to the last 1500 years or so, power was limited to animal and human effort.
      The first engines were water wheels and windmills — these were in use for several hundred years before the advent of the steam engine,
      but there was nothing we know of in the prior 3000 years.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mining stone blocks and floating them on barges to the pyramid site is fairly well understood and presents no insurmountable problems.
      <strong>Lifting the blocks</strong>, however, is more difficult and required some real power.
    </p>

    <p>
      Technically, one horsepower is the power delivered at a rate of 550 ft-lbs per second.
      The model lift engine delivers the equivalent of <strong>1000 hp</strong> but only during its lifting cycle;
      the maximum continuous output is about <strong>500 hp</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This enormous power would not be achieved again until the giant waterwheels that were built in the 19th century CE.
